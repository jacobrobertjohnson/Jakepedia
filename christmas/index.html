						<td>Shirts</td>
						<td>Medium</td>
						<td>Fitted is fine, but make sure the torso is long. At this time, I'd prefer plain shirts without characters or logos (pockets, buttons, etc. are fine. I'm just drowning in logo and character tees, and should dress like an adult sometimes)</td>
					</tr>

						<td>Socks</td>
						<td>For shoe sizes around 9 to 10</td>
						<td>Presently, I have room for thin, athletic-style no-show or ankle socks. No need for long or thick ones.</td>

						<td>Pants</td>
						<td>I'm picky and my weight fluctuates. Let me buy these myself.</td>

			<h2>Food</h2>

			<table cellspacing="0">
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Item</th>
						<th>Preferences</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Beef jerky</td>
						<td>
							<p>Don't try to be fancy: I really like regular or peppered flavors. I'm not the fondest of the spicy stuff.</p>
							<p>Style doesn't matter; it can be flat, in sticks, rolled in sausages, whatever.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Chips</td>
						<td>
							I'm a sucker for:
							<ul>
								<li>Original Ruffles</li>
								<li>Kettle-cooked potato chips, as long as they're well-salted</li>
								<li>Chili Cheese Fritos</li>
								<li>Snyder's of Hanover's Pretzel Pieces</li>
								<li>Sun Chips, occasionally</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cereal</td>
						<td>FROSTED MINI WHEATS</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Hot sauce</td>
						<td>
							I've narrowed down the sauces I like to the following ranked list:
							<ol>
								<li>Texas Pete's (normal, not the extra-hot variant)</li>
								<li>Valentina</li>
								<li>Sriracha sauce (occasionally)</li>
								<li>Tabasco sauce (occasionally)</li>
							</ol>
							Basically, the main goal is for flavor, and not heat. I'm not fond of over-the-top &quot;how hot can you handle?&quot; challenges, nor weird flavors (garlic, avocado, chocolate, etc.). And buffalo sauce acts like a laxative, so I avoid it.

					<tr>
						<td>Candy</td>
						<td>I like chocolate. It will disappear quickly, while fruity stuff will still be sitting around next Christmas. The best candies are Heath and Butterfingers.</td>
