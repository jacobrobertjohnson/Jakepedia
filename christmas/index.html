      <h2>Preamble</h2>
      <p>
        18 months of staring at grandparents' heaping estates has reinforced my
        aversion to unnecessary accumulation. My own house feels full enough,
        and filling it with more gifts makes me feel overwhelmed rather than
        loved.
      </p>
      <p>
        So when I say "just give me snacks," I mean it. I don't feel less loved
        when you do it; on the contrary, it's a win-win-win situation because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I like snacks</li>
        <li>I'm not overwhelmed with more stuff</li>
        <li>
          You don't pour effort into a gift that leaves me overwhelmed anyway
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Christmas List</h2>

      <p>
        All that being said, if you <em>must</em> get me something more
        substantial, I could use:
      </p>

      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>
          A set of vice grips (<a

            >Example</a
          >)
        </li>
        <li>
          The cheapest set of nine cabinet knobs or handles you can find. I
          don't care if it's used, mismatched, or anything else because I just
          want to put them on my ugly plywood tool drawers. (<a

          >).
        </li>
        <li>
          A new pair of batteries for my cordless Craftsman drill (<a

        </li>
        <li>
          A couple of corded halogen work lights (<a

            >Example</a
          >). Don't substitute battery-powered or LED ones; those eat AA
          batteries and start losing brightness after a few minutes.
        </li>
      </ul>

        When (because it's inevitable) you are looking at clothing or food
        items, hopefully the below guide answers any questions you may have.

          Hot sauce gift sets (they contain one okay flavor, and the rest fall
          under #1)
        </li>
        <li>
          Most food gift sets, honestly. I always end up throwing away half of
          any given set because of #1
        </li>
        <li>
          The tools that Menards or Harbor Freight give away. They either:
          <ul>
            <li>Duplicate something I already have</li>
            <li>Break the first time I use them</li>

                Style doesn't matter; it can be flat, in sticks, rolled in

              <p>
                I've narrowed down the sauces I like to the following ranked
                list:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Texas Pete's (normal, not the extra-hot variant)</li>
                <li>Valentina</li>
                <li>Sriracha sauce (occasionally)</li>
                <li>Tabasco sauce (occasionally)</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Basically, the main goal is for flavor, and not heat. I'm not
                fond of over-the-top &quot;how hot can you handle?&quot;
                challenges, nor weird flavors (garlic, avocado, chocolate,
                etc.). And buffalo sauce acts like a laxative, so I avoid it.

                <li>Pistacios</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Avoid any of the "lightly-salted" nonsense. It's an offense
                against God, America, and everything good in this world.
