      <h2>Preamble</h2>
      <p>
        30 months of staring at grandparents' heaping estates has reinforced my
        aversion to unnecessary accumulation. My own house feels full enough,
        and
        <em
          >filling it with more gifts makes me feel overwhelmed rather than
          loved.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        So when I say "just give me snacks," I mean it. I don't feel less loved
        when you do it; on the contrary, it's a win-win-win situation because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I like snacks</li>
        <li>I'm not overwhelmed with more stuff</li>
        <li>
          You don't pour effort into a gift that leaves me overwhelmed anyway
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Christmas List</h2>

      <p>
        All that being said, if you <em>must</em> get me something more
        substantial, I could use:
      </p>

      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>
          A set of vice grips (<a

        </li>

        <li>
          A tool belt. Preferably one with a hammer holster, room for a tape
          measure, some screwdriver/utility knife holsters, and a spot for easy
          fastener access.

          for marking plywood and drywall.<br />
          <em
            >(I'm not sure why I haven't just bought one yet. Might as well put
            it on my Christmas list at this point.)</em
          >
        </li>

        <li>
          A copy of
          <a href="https://a.co/d/cnWnLaa" target="_blank"
            >"The Great Divorce"</a
          >
          by C. S. Lewis. Used is fine.

          Hot sauce gift sets (they contain one okay flavor, and the rest fall
          under #1)
        </li>
        <li>
          Most food gift sets, honestly. I always end up throwing away half of
          any given set because of #1
        </li>
        <li>
          The tools that Menards or Harbor Freight give away. They either:
          <ul>
            <li>Duplicate something I already have</li>
            <li>Break the first time I use them</li>

                Style doesn't matter; it can be flat, in sticks, rolled in
                sausages, stuffed with cheese, whatever.

                I've narrowed down the sauces I like to the following ranked
                list:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Texas Pete's (normal, not the extra-hot variant)</li>
                <li>
                  Valentina
                  <em
                    ><span class="highlight"
                      >(Hold off on this one. I have more than enough right
                      now)</span
                    ></em
                  >
                </li>
                <li>Sriracha sauce (occasionally)</li>
                <li>Tabasco sauce (occasionally)</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Basically, the main goal is for flavor, and not heat. I'm not
                fond of over-the-top &quot;how hot can you handle?&quot;
                challenges, nor weird flavors (garlic, avocado, chocolate,
                etc.). And buffalo sauce acts like a laxative, so I avoid it.
